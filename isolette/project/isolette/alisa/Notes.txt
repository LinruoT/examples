A 1.2 System Goals expressed as stakeholder goals.

For core model properties we use VAL to record the value from the requirement text. We use the value predicate to ensure the model has an assigned property of the same value.
NOTE: that for specific verification methods we can specify that the VAL value is expected to be set as property.
NOTE: This only works for the target element being verified, not for subcomponents. We would want a way of providing such property values across the instance like a configuration.

We use property constants for EMV2 values. Used in both property assignment and in ReqSpec. 
We want to validate that the value is the same in requirements and the model. 
Currently we cannot access EMV2 property values in reqspec expressions. Would have to write a Java validation method.
Instead we ensure the same value by referring to the constant in the property and in Reqspec VAL assignment (VAL so we can use it in the description text).

Environmental Assumptions are done as system requirements for the respective system component. They primarily represent input assumptions and are marked appropriately withe the category attribute.

Safety requirement SR2 makes assumptions about end to end latency for alarm response, i.e., the time it takes to raise an alarm and for the nurse to respond.
We define a system modeling the operational environment of the Isolette and defined an end to end flow there. We have a 3 tier model with Tier1 capturing the stated requirement, 
and Tier2/3 refining the flow as the design is expanded to a regulator and monitor.

************

the sections include tables showing monitored and controlled variables. These become incoming and outgoing features/ports on the respective component.


There is also a valid/invalid bit in the alarm and desired temperature value as well. invalid if inconsistent ranges. Passed on to Thermostat. Thermostat monitor then raises alarm.
Unclear who is responsible for ensuring correct desired and alarm ranges (OI or TH). I would not allow invalid values to be set in thermostat.


A 4 Safety Requirements
As stakeholder goals

SR-1: no property value for 10e-5

SR-2: not trusted if bad OI desired and alarm range & internal failure. Probability of 10e-5.

Thermostat system function:

regulator status and monitor status: how actually sets them since they reflect that they failed.

Issues: current temperature only via thermostat, no direct reporting from thermo sensor to OI.

Figure A-2: reflected in thermostat implementation.
AADL model has detect_regulator_fail device that is not connected to anything.
Monitor_Temp needs to do more than monitor current temp within specified range. Also bad input and internal failure of regulator (and monitor?)


Observation: Some text is written using the Observed/Control variable model. Setting the variable makes the value available to others.
There is the question of persistence of the variable. Does it need to be set every period or just transmitted every period, or transmitted as state change event?
This Paradigm "mismatch" can create potential problems.


Figure A-3: Figure has Detect Regulator Failure as function, but AADL does not. The detect function is part of the EMV2 specification and to be passed as an internal eveent to the Manage Regulator Mode function.

Finally, in REQ-MRI-4 we get infomred who is to convert temp into integer values adn the rounding to be used.
