A 1.2 System Goals expressed as stakeholder goals.

A.2 Operational Concepts

Nurse as actor interacts with Isolette via Thermostat interface. We do not explicitly model the interaction as connection from nurse. 
We also do not explicitly expose the thermostat interface as Isolette interface.

Use Cases as Goals with indication of related system goals (Gx)

How to express precondition, post conditions, and use case steps.

A 2.1 use case:
turn on thermostat via modes at the Isolette level, or via on/off modes inside the thermostat.

Use of Alisa constants for values that are used in several reqspec groupings. 
We want to validate that any property has the respective value of val.

There are also Property constants. We cannot use property constants in description strings, only vals.

Environmental Assumptions: Could be done a stakeholder goals
the sections include tables showing monitored and controlled variables. These become incoming and outgoing features/ports on the respective component.


Issue: FAA HB does temperature in integer, while model spec is in real. Issue: internal representation vs. operator interface values.

There is also a valid/invalid bit in the alarm and desired temperature value as well. invalid if inconsistent ranges. Passed on to Thermostat. Thermostat monitor then raises alarm.
Unclear who is responsible for ensuring correct desired and alarm ranges (OI or TH). I would not allow invalid values to be set in thermostat.


A 4 Safety Requirements
As stakeholder goals

SR-1: no property value for 10e-5

SR-2: not trusted if bad OI desired and alarm range & internal failure. Probability of 10e-5.

Thermostat system function:

regulator status and monitor status: how actually sets them since they reflect that they failed.

Issues: current temperature only via thermostat, no direct reporting from thermo sensor to OI.

Figure A-2: reflected in thermostat implementation.
AADL model has detect_regulator_fail device that is not connected to anything.
Monitor_Temp needs to do more than monitor current temp within specified range. Also bad input and internal failure of regulator (and monitor?)
