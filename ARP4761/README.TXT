This example reproduces the Wheel Brake System described
in the ARP4761 and AIR6110 standards. It was originally
designed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to demonstrate the following
capabilities of OSATE:
- Fault Hazard Assesment
- Fault Impact (FMEA/FMES)
- Fault Tree Analysis

A complete description of the case-study is available on:
